This code depends on the closest point method codebase cp_matrices. This 
codebase is available on GitHub at https://github.com/cbm755/cp_matrices.
The current directory structure has both cp_matrices and harmonic_maps on 
the Desktop.

Folders containing code from Nathan King and Steven Ruuth, "Solving 
variational problems and partial differential equations mapping between 
manifolds via the closest point method", Journal of Computational Physics, 2017.

Figures in paper can be reproduced using code within. All code has been setup 
with larger grid spacings, dx, to enable computation on a personal computer. 
For refined results shown in paper most codes were ran on Compute Canada's 
Westgrid servers.
