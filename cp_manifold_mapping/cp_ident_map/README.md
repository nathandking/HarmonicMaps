Identity map computation via harmonic maps. This example gives us a means 
for convergence studies since identity maps are harmonic. 

Details found in Nathan King and Steven Ruuth, "Solving variational 
problems and partial differential equations mapping between manifolds via 
the closest point method", Journal of Computational Physics, 2017.

Examples for a sphere, ellipsoid and torus are given here.
