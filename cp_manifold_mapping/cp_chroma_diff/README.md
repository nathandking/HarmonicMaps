Chroma diffusion using harmonic maps between the plane and sphere detailed 
in Nathan King and Steven Ruuth, "Solving variational problems and partial 
differential equations mapping between manifolds via the closest point 
method", Journal of Computational Physics, 2017.

Both isotropic (p=2) and anisotropic (p=1) diffusion are implemented.
