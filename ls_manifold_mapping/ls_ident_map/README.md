Identity map computation via harmonic maps. This example gives us a means 
for convergence studies since identity maps are harmonic. 

This is the level set version. Details found in Facundo MÃ©moli, Guillermo 
Sapiro, and Stanley Osher. "Solving variational problems and partial 
differential equations mapping into general target manifolds." Journal of 
Computational Physics 195.1 (2004): 263-292.

Examples for a sphere, ellipsoid and torus are given here.
